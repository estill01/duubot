# Envisoned Interaction
Start with a blank slate except 'You' in the middle.
Click to add a new entity.

Then, map out how the entities are interacting -- a situation
* What are the entities
* Why they are doing what they are doing (/what they want)
* How do the individual activities/motivations of the entities Interaction
* What you want
* What are the "concern factors"
* What do good outcomes look like
* etc.

Then take this map and submit it to groups of your choosing for response.
Responses will draw upon a standardized toolkit of response types

Voting, reputation, etc.

# Response Types
Users can (will be able to) post through standardized structured interfaces
* agendas (top-level containers)
* situations (events encountered within agenda-scoped operation)
* goals (polymorphic; basically everything gets a goal set)
* plans (possile as well as selected actions to take in dealing with a situation)
* requirements (blocking facts)
* resources (available tools)
